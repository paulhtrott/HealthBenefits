==============
Java Web Project for Java Web Programming Course.
This project will be a model for the full application that will be implemented
at a later date with actual data. Later release project will use Spring MVC framework
for cleaner implementation. 
Current class project application is using Derby db. Later release will use
mySQL DB.

This is a practice for me of using MVC design patterns, Git, GitHub, Unit Testing,
writing SQL scripts and writing Linux command line. I also set up an old box with
Ubuntu Linux server edition with Tomcat and FTP for testing my WAR files.
