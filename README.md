Health Benefits
==============
Java Web Project for Java Web Programming Course.
This project will be a model for the full application that will be implemented
at a later date with actual data. Later release project will use Spring MVC framework or (Stripes)
for cleaner implementation. Current class project application is using Derby db.
Later release will use mySQL DB (or PostgreSQL).

This is a practice for me of using MVC design patterns with JSPs and Servlets, Git, GitHub, Unit Testing,
working with a DB, writing SQL scripts and writing Linux command line. I also set up an old DELL box with
Ubuntu Linux server edition with Tomcat and FTP for testing WAR files.

Next time around I will use BootStrap Framework, for a responsiveness.
Used BootStrap on PaulHTrott.com
